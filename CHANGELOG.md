# Changelog

Notable changes to targum, newest first. Versions follow the 4-digit
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` in `pyproject.toml` and are tagged in git.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Video import: `targum build <youtube-url>` fetches a YouTube video with yt-dlp
  (CLI only, single videos, capped at 480p and 4 GB) and runs it through the same
  transcription and translation pipeline as audio. Direct links to video files and
  uploaded video files (mp4, m4v, mov, webm, mkv) work the same way.
- A video panel in the reader: off by default, toggled from the toolbar, showing the
  part's picture in a corner card while the existing player strip stays the transport.
  The picture is a sidecar file beside the reader — never inlined, never fetched from
  any network — and a reader folder copied without it degrades to the audio reader.
- The server streams video with Range requests, revalidation, and a response
  deadline; hosted uploads accept video suffixes (4 GB per file against one 8 GB
  media quota).
- Read-aloud recordings for prose: an external reading (a LibriVox book) can be
  attached to a text, force-aligned once, and cut into one part per section with
  word-level timings; the reader gets per-line playback and word clocks.
- The weekly landing page names the outlets its reporting cites, in their own marks.
- `--video/--no-video` on `targum build`, and a yt-dlp preflight check.

### Changed
- The serve policy's `media-src` gains `'self'` for the video sidecars
  (design.md §12, "a reader that carries moving pictures").
- Hosted pastes of YouTube links are refused by name with a pointer at the CLI.

### Fixed
- A failed video transcode no longer leaves a truncated file that later builds
  trust; a re-cut part is copied beside the reader atomically.
- Recording folder slugs hash only genuinely non-ASCII sources, so ASCII sources
  with underscores keep the folders they already have.
